Provo is full of individuals looking for fun dates. They want food, but not too expensive. They want a sit down restaurant while still having a casual, fun atmosphere to talk and have fun. Tacos check these boxes. They are simple, versatile, and loved by many. But how do you know which taco restaurant to go to? There are so many options. Let's Talk Tacos is here to help. This idea sparked from a simple date idea: try one taco from five different places and rank them. This app picks a random taco place within a specified mile radius to go and try. The app also displays additional information, such as address, photos, and menu. You can then add the place to your list, and generate another to try as well. After eating at the restuarant, the app prompts you to rank it based on taste, atmosphere, and overall satisfaction. An easy, effective date idea for taco enthusiasts, friends, and couples!

Key features: taco place generator from (1) location in certain mile radius, (2) certain day, and (3) time (to ensure the restaurant is open), "My List" with taco shops generated previously, rating feature, and global rankings for a specific location (zip code)

From HTML/simon assignments this week:
I learned more about svg! To use a qudratic formula to shape the 4 parts of the simon game.
Use span to make certain elements more stylable in the future
Honestly it was super useful to test my knowledge, to see the website and build it myself! It showed what I know and what I need to learn more about (ie. svg)
I feel more confident with buttons, tables, and input boxes now too!

From CSS assignments this week:
flex has three values: grow, shrink, basis. So you can override the default (0, 1, auto) and write your own numbers. Think of it as flex: [max] [min] [ideal size];
<sup> means superscript, &reg = keyboard shortcut for circle R
flex: 1 calc(100vh - 110px); calculates height, 100% of viewport's height minus 110 pixels
flex: 1; = flex-grow 1, flex-shrink 1, flex-basis 0

Bootstrap icons: npm i bootstrap-icons (I downloaded them on Figma)
